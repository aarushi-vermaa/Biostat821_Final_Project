# Lets play Tic-Tac-Toe 


Welcome to the TickTacToe game. This repository is for the Final Project for BIOSTATS821 course - Software Tools for Data Science at Duke Univeristy.
We are building a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. The user can play against another user or against the computer using the command prompt.


## How to Play

### The Board:

```
[['', '', ''],

  ['', '', ''],
  
  ['', '', '']]
```

### Human versus Human:
If two human players are playing, the command prompt will display which Player's turn it is. To play your turn, you must specify the position to be played on the 3x3 grid. 


### Human versus Computer:
If you are playing against the computer, the command prompt will display which Player's turn it is. To play your turn, you must specify the position to be played on the 3x3 grid, after that the computer will perform its move.


### Game Over:
Once the game has a winner or there is a draw, you will see prompt stating the outcome. From here you can start a new game by **(to update how)**
