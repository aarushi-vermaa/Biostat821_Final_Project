# Lets play Tic-Tac-Toe 

Welcome to the TickTacToe game. This repository is for the Final Project for BIOSTATS821 course - Software Tools for Data Science at Duke Univeristy.
We are building a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. The user can play against another user or against the computer using the command prompt.


## How to Play

### The Board

```
[['', '', ''],

  ['', '', ''],
  
  ['', '', '']]
```
The board is a 3x3 grid as represented above. Each player can place their mark (either X or O) during their respective turns by entering thei (To update with how numbers relate to the grid)

### Players Selection 
When the game is loaded, you need to select your players. You need to select the type of player you want by [to be updated], either computer or human. The player who goes first is selected randomly

### Human versus Human
If two human players are playing, the command prompt will display which Player's turn it is. To play your turn, you must specify the position to be played on the 3x3 grid. 

### Human versus Computer
If you are playing against the computer, the command prompt will display which Player's turn it is. To play your turn, you must specify the position to be played on the 3x3 grid, after that the computer will perform its move.

## Getting up and running:

This project is built with Python 3. In order to play the game, please follow the following steps:

Step 1: Git clone the repo on your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/aarushi-vermaa/Biostat821_Final_Project.git
```
This will clone all the files on Github to your local machine

Step 2: Install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Running this command will install the packages used to build the game. This will allow you to play the game seamlessly

Step 3: Download the data by running the download_data.py file by navigating to the /00_setup folder
